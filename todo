## Before going live:

- Bugs:

  - All notes seem to play at once when starting the sound engine.
  - I shouldn't show the "Hey please click" message if the player is already available.

- Functionality:
  - Instrument selection based on the items available in the midi player.
  - Add randomness for empty notes. "Empty note chance" -> [None][Some][Many]
  - Clicking on "New Notes" should set the grid back to index 0 before playing the notes.

## Ideas to explore:

- Add a circle of 5ths.
- Animate the line with a dot or something could be fun.
- Add a very small representation of the note names to the drawn title line.
- Useful keyboard shortcuts.
  - [Space] for play/pause.
  - [N] = new notes.
  - [R] = Reset.
  - [S] = Save as midi.
  - [1 -> 8] could toggle the selected octaves?
- Octaves could be grouped meaningfully. Maybe some sort of indication left of the current row title.
- Show notes on a guitar fretboard. Make it possible to switch between piano roll and fretboard mode.
  - Rhythms/chord mode vs Lead mode?
- The user should be able to drag notes into other slots that fit the scale by literally clicking and dragging a given note.
- Save multiple configurations you've enjoyed. Be able to load them up later.
- Allow single note items to be played as if they're tremolo'd.
  - Add "Tremolo" as a variable. Tremolo X of the selected notes randomly.
- Allow a single note to ring over multiple indexes. Add this as a variable with randomness.
- "Stop" button that resets the notes being played back to the 0 index?
- More interesting visualizations of the generated notes.
- Increase possible number of generated notes.
- A zooming mechanism to navigate the notes that have been generated.
- Cypress for integration level tests.
- 7 String guitar mode.
- Different guitar tunings
