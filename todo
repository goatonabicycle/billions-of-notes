# Todo now

x Add a ukelele instrument. 
- Make "Tie notes" tie the actual notes together visually. 
x Add more instruments.  Ones that sound cool. The distorted guitar ones kinda suck.
- Flat vs sharp mode. Make it an option. Options page, generally?
- Piano uses flats when the rest of the app uses sharps. 


  ### Sounds 
    - Record and save to mp3. 
    - See about replacing the sound player with: https://github.com/danigb/smplr
  
  ### Functionality
    - Save multiple configurations you've enjoyed. Be able to load them up later.
    - https://www.billionsofnotes.com/what-scale -> This could go back to the main page with the key and scale selected.  
    - There are still some unnecessary rerenders happening especially around the instruments being played. I should be able to optimize this.    
    - A more in depth "These are the notes in this scale" mode. Show the whole and half steps.
    - Allow a single note to ring over multiple indexes. Add this as a variable with randomness.
    - Bass component: The tuning of bass guitars is strange because when it gets to 6 strings it doesn't just go lower. Cater for this.  
    - Allow single note items to be played as if they're tremolo'd.
      - Add "Tremolo" as a variable. Tremolo X of the selected notes randomly.
  
  ### Style
    - Improve the theme for dark mode
    - Finish styling the new, improved fretboard. Invert the colors for the fretboard maybe? Make the playing notes bright and non playable notes dark. To make things more obvious

# Maybe later: 
  - Get the count stuff back and have it not cause a render. 
  - Add many more random interactive messages. Make this more prominent and obvious.
  - "Show me how to play this"/Import Midi. The fretboard is pretty cool. Having a way to import a midi file and then show you how to play it would be awesome. 
    - Add some sort of  "Don't play stuff... I'm just looking at the fretboard" mode. (Continue with ShowMe.js)
  - For any scale, when hovering over the notes on the fretboard, show the relationship that note has with the root note. (Minor third, Perfect 5th, etc)
  - Give me a second verse with these notes -> This could use the same notes but maybe change the last note to something else?
  - "I like these notes, Give me a variation" -> Use the current notes but jiggle them around
  - At least add a duplicate? This would double up the number of notes and empty notes.
  - Chords. Chords that make sense in the context of the current notes.
  - More interesting visualizations of the generated notes. Perhaps the pattern followed on the current fretboard?
  - Add a circle of 5ths
  - Add a vertical piano roll with the notes coming down from the top.
