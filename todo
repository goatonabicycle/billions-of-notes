## Todo

- Finish styling the new, improved fretboard.
- Add randomness for empty notes. "Empty note chance" -> [None][Some][Many]
  - These notes should not be played.
- A popup explaining the idea and wtf this is.
- Useful keyboard shortcuts.
  - [Space] for play/pause.
  - [N] = new notes.
  - [R] = Reset.
  - [S] = Save as midi.
  - [1 -> 8] could toggle the selected octaves?
- Generally improve accessibility
- Save multiple configurations you've enjoyed. Be able to load them up later.
- Add many more random interactive messages.
- Palm mute mode.
- Add more instruments.
  - I should consider adding duration properties to each of these manually
- Support different tunings.
- The ability to dynamically add and remove strings.
- For any scale, when hovering over the notes on the fretboard, show the relationship that note has with the root note. (Minor third, Perfect 5th, etc)
- Animate the line with a dot or something could be fun.
- Add a very small representation of the note names to the drawn title line.
- Octaves could be grouped meaningfully. Maybe some sort of indication left of the current row title.
- Make playing chords a possibility?
- The user should be able to drag notes into other slots that fit the scale by literally clicking and dragging a given note.
- Allow single note items to be played as if they're tremolo'd.
  - Add "Tremolo" as a variable. Tremolo X of the selected notes randomly.
- Allow a single note to ring over multiple indexes. Add this as a variable with randomness.
- More interesting visualizations of the generated notes.
- Increase possible number of generated notes.
- A zooming mechanism to navigate the notes that have been generated.
- Cypress for integration level tests.
- Add a circle of 5ths
- Add a vertical piano roll with the notes comingdown from the top.
