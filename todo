Feedback 
x Make the distinction between the fretboard and the pianoroll more clear. 
- Could I add sheet music stuff? 
x Make the actually generated notes more obvious. Not just on the PianoRoll
x Create a better sense of [Input] -> [Generated Output]
? Quarter notes of half notes. 
x Guitar mode vs Piano mode. 
- Add more modes.
- Finish styling the new, improved fretboard.
  - Invert the colors for the fretboard maybe? Make the playing notes bright and non playable notes dark. To make things more obvious
  
Guitar component: Make it possible to change the number of frets you care about.
Bass component: The tuning of bass guitars is strange because when it gets to 6 strings it doesn't just go lower. Cater for this.

- There's definitely some sort of audio rendering bug at play. 
- Fix the sharing mechanism. 
x The ability to dynamically add and remove strings.
- Support different guitar tunings.

  - [Space] for play/pause.
  - [N] = new notes.

  - I should consider adding duration properties to each of these manually
- For any scale, when hovering over the notes on the fretboard, show the relationship that note has with the root note. (Minor third, Perfect 5th, etc)

- Make playing chords a possibility?
- The user should be able to drag notes into other slots that fit the scale by literally clicking and dragging a given note.
- Allow single note items to be played as if they're tremolo'd.
  - Add "Tremolo" as a variable. Tremolo X of the selected notes randomly.
- Allow a single note to ring over multiple indexes. Add this as a variable with randomness.
- More interesting visualizations of the generated notes.
- Increase possible number of generated notes. (Performance)
- A zooming mechanism to navigate the notes that have been generated.
- Cypress for integration level tests.
- Add a circle of 5ths
