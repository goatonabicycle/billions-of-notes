Before going live:

- Aesthetic. Name and logo.
- Readme.
- Get a proper favicon
- Instrument selection.
- A less intrusive UI that allows for more space for the notes.
- Add randomness for empty notes.
- Save/Share/Load App state.

Ideas to explore:

- Show notes on an actual fretboard.
- Rhythms mode vs Lead mode.
- Save multiple configurations you've liked.
