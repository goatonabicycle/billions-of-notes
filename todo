## Todo  
  
# Do mode:

- https://www.billionsofnotes.com/what-scale -> This could go back to the main page with the key and scale selected.
- Improve the theme for dark mode
- There are still some unnecessary rerenders happening especially around the instruments being played. I should be able to optimize this.
- The notes being played overlap in some views. 
- Give me a second verse with these notes -> This could use the same notes but maybe change the last note to something else?
  - "I like these notes, Give me a variation" -> Use the current notes but jiggle them around
  - At least add a duplicate? This would double up the number of notes and empty notes.
- For any scale, when hovering over the notes on the fretboard, show the relationship that note has with the root note. (Minor third, Perfect 5th, etc)
- Flat vs sharp mode. Make it an option. Options page, generally?
- Number of frets -> Make this a two way slider. 
- Add more instruments.  Ones that sound cool. The distorted guitar ones kinda suck.
- Allow single note items to be played as if they're tremolo'd.
  - Add "Tremolo" as a variable. Tremolo X of the selected notes randomly.
- Record and save to mp3. 
- "Show me how to play this"/Import Midi. The fretboard is pretty cool. Having a way to import a midi file and then show you how to play it would be awesome. 
  - Add some sort of  "Don't play stuff... I'm just looking at the fretboard" mode. (Continue with ShowMe.js)
- See about replacing the sound player with: https://github.com/danigb/smplr
- Get the count stuff back. 
- Add many more random interactive messages. Make this more prominent and obvious.
- Finish styling the new, improved fretboard.
  - Invert the colors for the fretboard maybe? Make the playing notes bright and non playable notes dark. To make things more obvious
- A more in depth "These are the notes in this scale" mode. Show the whole and half steps.
- Bass component: The tuning of bass guitars is strange because when it gets to 6 strings it doesn't just go lower. Cater for this.  
- Save multiple configurations you've enjoyed. Be able to load them up later.
- Chords. Chords that make sense in the context of the current notes.
- Allow a single note to ring over multiple indexes. Add this as a variable with randomness.
- More interesting visualizations of the generated notes. Perhaps the pattern followed on the current fretboard?
- Add a circle of 5ths
- Add a vertical piano roll with the notes coming down from the top.
