Before going live:

- Save/Share/Load App state.
- Analytics
- Bug: All notes seem to play at once when starting the sound engine.
- Have some sort of indication of the notes that are in the current selected Key and Mode.
- Aesthetic. Name and logo. Readme. Favicon
- Instrument selection.
- A less intrusive UI that allows for more space for the notes.
- Add randomness for empty notes.

Ideas to explore:

- Animate the line with a dot or something could be fun.
- Useful keyboard shortcuts.
- Show notes on an actual fretboard.
- Rhythms mode vs Lead mode.
- Save multiple configurations you've liked.
