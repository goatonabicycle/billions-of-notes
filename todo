## Before going live:

- Functionality:

  - Instrument selection based on the items available in the midi player.

    - I should consider adding duration properties to each of these manually
    - 5 - Acoustic Grand Piano
    - 15 - Bright Accoustic Piano
    - 26 - Electric Grand Piano
    - 32 - Honky Tonk Piano
    - 43 - Electric Piano
    - 73 - Harpsicord
    - 84 - Clavinet
    - 91 - Celesta
    - 102 - Glockenspiel
    - 111 - Music box
    - 121 - Vibraphone
    - 125 - Marimba
    - 137 - Xylophone

  - Add randomness for empty notes. "Empty note chance" -> [None][Some][Many]

## Ideas to explore:

- WTF is this website modal.
- Different guitar tunings
- Animate the line with a dot or something could be fun.
- Add a very small representation of the note names to the drawn title line.
- Useful keyboard shortcuts.
  - [Space] for play/pause.
  - [N] = new notes.
  - [R] = Reset.
  - [S] = Save as midi.
  - [1 -> 8] could toggle the selected octaves?
- Octaves could be grouped meaningfully. Maybe some sort of indication left of the current row title.
- Show notes on a guitar fretboard. Make it possible to switch between piano roll and fretboard mode.
  - Rhythms/chord mode vs Lead mode?
- The user should be able to drag notes into other slots that fit the scale by literally clicking and dragging a given note.
- Save multiple configurations you've enjoyed. Be able to load them up later.
- Allow single note items to be played as if they're tremolo'd.
  - Add "Tremolo" as a variable. Tremolo X of the selected notes randomly.
- Allow a single note to ring over multiple indexes. Add this as a variable with randomness.
- "Stop" button that resets the notes being played back to the 0 index?
- More interesting visualizations of the generated notes.
- Increase possible number of generated notes.
- A zooming mechanism to navigate the notes that have been generated.
- Cypress for integration level tests.
- 7 String guitar mode.
- The fretboard would be cool with a hover effect that highlights all the other places where that note is.
- Add a circle of 5ths
