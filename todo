## Todo

# BUGS!!!
  - Play pause isn't working at the moment. :O 
  - Occasionally, the Guitar (and likely the bass) component does not show any notes being played. Other components do seem to have notes though. This seems to happen when deselecting the guitar component and reselecting it in the "Show me" control.
  - The localstorage idea isn't working anymore. Reloading a page after changing any of inputs reset it back to the initial state. 
  - Sharing isn't working as intended. Probably related to how storage is handled. 
  - Changing the tuning of the guitar component does not result in the "reset tuning" button showing up immediately (It does after reloading though. Skill/state issue.)
  - Ghost note when a request gets made to update the "Total notes generated" count.
  - Right now, the theming for dark mode sucks so much that it seems broken.

# Do mode:

- There are many unnecessary rerenders happening. I should be able to optimize this.
- A more in depth "These are the notes in this scale" mode. Show the whole and half steps.
- Add many more random interactive messages. Make this more prominent and obvious.
- Give me a second verse with these notes -> This could use the same notes but maybe change the last note to something else?
  - "I like these notes, Give me a variation" -> Use the current notes but jiggle them around
- For any scale, when hovering over the notes on the fretboard, show the relationship that note has with the root note. (Minor third, Perfect 5th, etc)
- Flat vs sharp mode. Make it an option. Options page, generally?
- Number of frets -> Make this a two way slider. 
- Add a light/dark mode. Use something like this: https://uiverse.io/andrew-demchenk0/nasty-frog-73
  - This is added but it sucks right now. I can/should make this way nicer.
- Add more instruments.  Ones that sound cool. The distorted guitar ones kinda suck.
- Allow single note items to be played as if they're tremolo'd.
  - Add "Tremolo" as a variable. Tremolo X of the selected notes randomly.
- Record and save to mp3. 
- Add some sort of  "Don't play stuff... I'm just looking at the fretboard" mode. 
- See about replacing the sound player with: https://github.com/danigb/smplr

# Think about it mode: 
- Finish styling the new, improved fretboard.
  - Invert the colors for the fretboard maybe? Make the playing notes bright and non playable notes dark. To make things more obvious
- Bass component: The tuning of bass guitars is strange because when it gets to 6 strings it doesn't just go lower. Cater for this.  
- Save multiple configurations you've enjoyed. Be able to load them up later.
- Chords. Chords that make sense in the context of the current notes.
- Allow a single note to ring over multiple indexes. Add this as a variable with randomness.
- More interesting visualizations of the generated notes. Perhaps the pattern followed on the current fretboard?
- Add a circle of 5ths
- Add a vertical piano roll with the notes coming down from the top.
