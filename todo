Before going live:

- Bugs
  - All notes seem to play at once when starting the sound engine.
  - I shouldn't show the "Hey please click" message if the player is already available.
  - Line rendering is sometimes off. E3 -> A3 -> E4 for example shows a line that starts high and ends low.
  - When octaves have a gap, represent it in the NotesGrid somehow.
  - A less intrusive UI that allows for more space for the notes.
  - Compatability with various browsers. Looks like Firefox doesn't support class nesting. Ugh.
- Functionality:
  - Instrument selection.
  - Add randomness for empty notes.

Ideas to explore:

- "Buy me a coffee" link. ko.fi?
- Animate the line with a dot or something could be fun.
- Useful keyboard shortcuts.
- Octaves could be grouped meaningfully. That would mean not needing to render the notes being played with their octave numbers
- Show notes on a guitar fretboard. Switch between the two modes.
- Rhythms mode vs Lead mode.
- The user can drag notes into other slots that fit the scale.
- Save multiple configurations you've liked.
