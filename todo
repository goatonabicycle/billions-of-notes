## Todo

# Do mode:
x Fretboard items: Make it possible to change the number of frets you care about.
- Move the code and kofi stuff to the footer/elsewhere.
- A button with a modal explaining the idea and wtf this is.
  - Write a bunch of words for this.
- Fix the sharing mechanism. 
- Add more modes.
- Add more instruments.
  - Does it make sense for the individual elements to have custom duration properties?
- Generally improve accessibility. Tab through the elements should be clearly visible and flow well.
- Palm mute mode. The audio engine can create this effect. See the Loop Component. It's the last variable in `playChordNow`
- The notes generated should be editable. Perhaps you could drag them in the "What has been generated" set of blocks?
- Add many more random interactive messages. Make this more prominent and obvious.
- For any scale, when hovering over the notes on the fretboard, show the relationship that note has with the root note. (Minor third, Perfect 5th, etc)
- Add keyboard shortcuts.   - [Space] for play/pause.   - [N] = new notes.   - [R] = Reset.  - [S] = Save as midi.  

# Think about it mode: 
- Could I add sheet music stuff? 
- Finish styling the new, improved fretboard.
  - Invert the colors for the fretboard maybe? Make the playing notes bright and non playable notes dark. To make things more obvious
- Bass component: The tuning of bass guitars is strange because when it gets to 6 strings it doesn't just go lower. Cater for this.  
- Save multiple configurations you've enjoyed. Be able to load them up later.
- Make playing chords a possibility?
- Allow single note items to be played as if they're tremolo'd.
  - Add "Tremolo" as a variable. Tremolo X of the selected notes randomly.
- Allow a single note to ring over multiple indexes. Add this as a variable with randomness.
- More interesting visualizations of the generated notes. Perhaps the pattern followed on the current fretboard?
- A zooming mechanism to navigate the notes that have been generated.
- Cypress for integration level tests.
- Add a circle of 5ths
- Add a vertical piano roll with the notes coming down from the top.
