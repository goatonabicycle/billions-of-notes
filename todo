- Bugs
  - All notes seem to play at once when starting the sound engine.
  - I shouldn't show the "Hey please click" message if the player is already available.
- Style:
  - Aesthetic. Name and logo. Readme. Favicon
  - Have some sort of indication of the notes that are in the current selected Key and Mode.
  - When octaves have a gap, represent it in the NotesGrid somehow.
  - A less intrusive UI that allows for more space for the notes.
- Functionality:
  - Instrument selection.
  - Add randomness for empty notes.

Ideas to explore:

- Animate the line with a dot or something could be fun.
- Useful keyboard shortcuts.
- Show notes on an actual fretboard.
- Rhythms mode vs Lead mode.
- Save multiple configurations you've liked.
