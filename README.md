# Billions of Notes!

This is a website! Amazing!

This website allows you to come up with melodies. Riffs even!

It allows you to select some pertinent attributes of the melody you want and then gives it to you.

I hope you find it helpful for your music endeavours!

## Where can I see it?

https://www.billionsofnotes.com

## Why did you make this?

It's a crazy amount of fun and it's super useful as an [inspiration mechanism](https://theswayofmountains.bandcamp.com/)

## Something is wrong!

Oh snap. Please let me know about it [here](https://github.com/goatonabicycle/billions-of-notes/issues)!

## How can I run this on my machine?

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.


## What else? 
I think that's it. Thank you!
